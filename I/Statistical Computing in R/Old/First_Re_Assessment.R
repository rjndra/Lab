# 7. Do the following in R studio and with R script to knit HTML output
# a) Define an object "rating" with 9, 2, 5, 8, 6, 1, 3. 2, 8, 4, 6, 8, 7, 1, 2, 6, 10, 5, 6, 9, 6, 2, 4, 7
# b) Replicate the given table obtained from SPSS software for the rating object in R

# 8. Use the "air quality" data as AQ to do following in R Studio with R script to knit HTML output:
# a) Replace missing values of Ozone variable with the best measure of central tendency
# b) Create a Date variable in AQ using Month and Day variable for year 2022.
# c) Create line plot of "Ozone" variable with "Date" as the row index and interpret it carefully
# d) Get class intervals of the cleaned Ozone variable using range, its square root and zero rounding
# e) Get frequency distribution (n and %) of Ozone variable class intervals and interpret it carefully


  
# 9. Do the following in R Studio with tidyverse package using R Script to knit HTML output
# a) Define a tibble having country, year, cases and population variables with 100 random data each
# b) Transform the cases variable as log of cases (LnCase) and population variable as log of population (LnPop)
# c) Create scatter plots of 1. Cases and population, 2. LnCase and population, 3. Cases and LnPop and 4.LnCase and LnPop in a single graph window with base R plot code and interpret it carefully

# OR

# Load the "igraph" package in R studio and do the basic SNA as follows with R script and HTML output:
# a) Define g as graph object with (1,2,2,3,3,4,4,1) as its elements
# b) Plot g with node color as green, node size as 30, link color as red and link size as 5 and interpret it
# c) Plot the g as undirected arguments and interpret it carefully
# d) Plot g with seven nodes and interpret it carefully
# e) Get degree, closeness and betweenness of g and interpret them carefully.

# 10. Use the cleaned "AQ" file in R studio and do as follows with R Scripts and HTML outputs:
# a) Get reference range of "Ozone" variable using mean and standard deviation
# b) Plot histogram of "Ozone" variable and show the outliers of "Ozone" with reference range limits
# c) Get reference range of "Ozone" variable using median and inter-quartile range
# d) Plot boxplot of "Ozone" variable and show the outliers of "Ozone" with reference range limits
# e) Write a summary of the results obtained from the histogram and boxplot

# OR

# 10. Do as follows in R Studio and do as follows with R script and HTML outputs:
# a) Open R and then go to Help and Manuals if PDF and open 'An Introduction to R' file
# b) Import this pdf file in R using "pdftools" package
# c) Perform pre-processing and create corpusÂ® afterwards
# d) Find the most frequent terms and create histogram of the most frequent 
# e) Create word cloud of the corpus, color it using rainbow or R Color Brewer package 
# f) Perform topic modelling and interpret the result carefully
